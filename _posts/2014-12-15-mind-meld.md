Circle up and two adjacent people are selected to "duel." The person to their right counts to three. On "three," the duelers simultaneously say two random words. Those are the starter words. Now the duel shifts one person to the left: the right hand dueler is now the counter and the person to the left of the other dueler is now involved. From this point out, on the count of three, the duelers should say something that they think is "in between" the last two words in the duel. The duel keeps rotating quickly until the two duelers say the same word; then everybody wins!

### Variations
* If one of the duelers stutters and doesnâ€™t say anything, their word is literally "silence."
