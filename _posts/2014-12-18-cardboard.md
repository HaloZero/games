### Setup
Lay out the cardboard on a flat surface. Each person draws a shape about the size of their hand with their name written in it. People take turns flipping a quarter onto the cardboard. If the quarter comes to rest touching a shape with someone's name in it, they have to drink. If it comes to rest touching no shape, the thrower gets to draw a shape that encloses the quarter about the size of their hand and write a new rule in it. The rule can be anything. On subsequent tosses if the quarter comes to rest touching that rule shape, the rule has to be followed.

### Example rules
* Drink whenever someone else does
* You have to draw new shapes with the pen in your mouth
* If the quarter falls off the sheet, everyone drinks.
