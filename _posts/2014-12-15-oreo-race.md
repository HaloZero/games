Everyone is handed an oreo. Each person should twist the oreo apart. Everyone should then straight up and place the cream half cream-side-down in the middle of their forehead. The game leader should then say go, and it’s a race to see who can eat the oreo half that is on their forehead first. No one is allowed to use their hands or any tools; the oreo can only be coaxed towards the mouth by tilting your head down or using face muscles. If your oreo drops, you’re out.
