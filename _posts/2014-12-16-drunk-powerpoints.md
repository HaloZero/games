### Prelude
Setup monitor / projector so that everyone can see it. Get drunk.

### Make topics
Cut up the paper into small slips. Everyone writes a few topics on separate slips and puts them in the bowl. They can be absolutely anything: "lady gaga", "1943", "yams".

### Present
Someone is picked to present. They search the internet for "TOPIC ppt" and choose the first PowerPoint presentation that is returned. Download it and then immediately give the presentation in 2 minutes. Remove the topic from the bowl once the presentation is done.
