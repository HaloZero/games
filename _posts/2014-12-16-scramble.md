Draw out a large box, about the size of a 4-square court. Make a queue outside the box. The first four people get on the corners of the box and one more person stands in the middle.

### Swaps
The goal of the four corner people is to get the middle person "out." This is done by "swapping" on them three times. A swap is when any two of the corner people swap positions without the middle person tagging an abandoned corner. More than two people are allowed to swap, e.g. a "cycle right" is allowed.

### Flow
Once the middle person has three swaps, they're out, they go to the back of the line and a new challenger is in the middle. If the person in the middle sucessfully makes it to an abandoned corner, they stay and become a new corner person, then whichever corner person is left without a corner is out, goes to the back of the line, and a new challenger is in the middle.
