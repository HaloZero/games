Everyone sits in a circle on the ground with their legs splayed and a beer placed a few inches in front of their crotch. People take turns tossing the ping pong balls at other people's beers. If your beer gets hit, you take a sip. You're allowed get up to retrieve a ping pong ball from outside the circle, but if your can is hit while you're up, you have to finish your beer.

Everybody wins.
