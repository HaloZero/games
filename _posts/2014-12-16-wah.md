Circle up. Someone will start with "the wah." They pass the wah by clapping their hands above their heads and slicing their hands down yelling "WAH," pointing at someone else in the circle. If you were pointed at, you receive the wah by yelling "WAH" and clapping your hands and slicing them up above your head. Once your hands are above your head, the people on either side of the circle have to slice your stomach with a similar hand motion. The wah continues to be passed until someone makes a mistake.
