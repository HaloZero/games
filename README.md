Encyclopedia of group games.

## Contributing
We'd love to have you add, clarify, expand, and jazz up our list of group games!

Want to add a new game or modify an existing description? Fork this repository on GitHub, modify the game descriptions, then submit a pull request to have your new games merged back into here.

Each of the game descriptions lives in the `_posts` folder. To add a new game, add a new file entitled `YYYY-MM-DD-GAME_TITLE.md` based on the empty template in `_drafts/blank.md` and fill out all the appropriate description information. See the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) for how to preview your game description.

## Description
In addition to the instructions for how to play the game, there's also some metadata that should be filled out so folks know when your game is best played and can find it easily.

* `title` should be the name of your game
* `alttitles` should be a list of other names people know your game by; this can be skipped
* `tags` should be a list of labels that classify your game
* `oneliner` should be a short catchy description of the game; maybe people who don't know the name remember what it's like
* `players` is a more specific range of how many players this game is good for
* `tools` is a list of physical tools you need to play the game; this can be skipped

### Tags
In order to help people find a game quickly, try to label your game with what broad category it applies to:

* `group-large` - Best played with 15+ people
* `group-medium` - Best played with 5+ people
* `group-small` - Best played with <5 people
* `no-tools` - No physical tools required to play
* `style-drinking` - Best played as a drinking game
* `style-spirit` - Best played as a spirit game
* `style-ongoing` - Has ongoing encounters throughout life
* `style-party` - Best played in a party
* `style-playground` - Best played out in the world
