## Gameplay
Setup by laying broom across the stand so that it's in the middle and balanced.

Everyone holds hands in a circle around the broom. The purpose of the game is not to touch the broom with any body part. Players now are challenged to, while holding hands, try to drag each other into the 'electric' broom.  Players are simeltaneously trying to drag each other into the broom.  Players can jump over broom, move away from broom, twist and turn, but cannot let go of hands.  If two people let go of each others' hands, both people are out.  If you touch the 'electric' broom, you're out.

Game continues until there is only one player left.  Other players act as referees for the game.
