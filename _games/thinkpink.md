TOOLS: none

Description:

The purpose of the game is to guess the phrase.  One person in the group thinks of a rhyming phrase made up of two words and is "It".  If the words have one syllable each, the "it" has "I have a think pink."  If the words have two syllables each, the "it" says "I have a Thinky Pinky."  If the words have three syllables each, the "it" says "I have a Thinkedy Pinkedy." It also has to give a clue.  The others have to guess what the rhyming phrase is.  

Example:
It says, I have a Thinky Pinky and the clue is Ben and Jerry's.
People guess lots of ideas, including Joey Schmoey and Very Berry.
Finally, the right answer is suggested: Chunky Monkey.
