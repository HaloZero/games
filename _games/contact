DESCRIPTION
I have a word in my head and other players have to guess it letter-by-letter.

The purpose of this game is to guess the it player's word.  The it player picks a noun (no proper nouns) and provides the first letter of their noun. The other players describe a word that starts with the same letter as hinted. The it player then states no it is X (another noun that starts with the same letter but not their chosen word).   

Example, the it player picks the word sheep and announces the word starts with S.
Player 1 asks: Is it an animal that slithers.
It player: No, it is not a snack.
Player 2 asks: Is it a thing you put on your feet.
It player: No, it is not a sock.

If the player cannot get the word, he or she has to reveal the second letter of the word.  As a fail safe, two players must both know what the word from the clue.

Example, the word is sheep.
Player 1 asks: Is it a skin encased meat (referencing sausage)
If the it player cannot think of an S word and sits in silence.
Player 2 (or any other player): Says 'contact,' meaning they think they know what player 1 is referencing.
Player 3: Counts 1-2-3 and both player 1 and player 2 say their word at the same time.  If the word is the same, the it player reveals their next letter. If the word is different, the game continues.
Players should determine what length of time to give the it player before playing contact.  Time can range from 1 minute to 5 seconds.

For each consecuative letter, the word choices are more limited to the letters that are hinted..

Example, the word is sheep and the it player has released the letters S and H.
Player 1: Does it float on the sea?
It Player: No, it is not a SHip.
Player 2: It is a body part?
It player: No it is not a SHin.

This continues until other players guess the word or players eliminates all letters.
