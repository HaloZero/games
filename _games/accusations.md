## Gameplay
People take turns being the accuser. The accuser points at someone and accuses them of something (e.g. "David has peed the bed in the last year!"). Everyone else who thinks it's true raises their hand. The accused then reveals if it's true. Those who guessed wheither it was true incorrectly drink.
