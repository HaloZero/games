Everyone is handed at least one fork. Circle up. Someone lobs an apple underhand to anyone left with a fork. They should try to spear the falling apple with their fork. If they do, they leave the fork in the apple and lob the apple+fork up to someone else, who will attempt to spear and add their fork. Repeat until the apple falls apart or your run out of forks. Careful with your hands!
