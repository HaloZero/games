# Setup
Everyone circles up!

# Gameplay
This is a "pass the energy" game. It also has a rhythm; every action happens on four beats, two beats for recieving the energy, two beats for sending it, and repeat.

The energy starts with someone, they recieve it by saying "bunny bunny" (two beats) while pointing to themselves, then they send it by saying "bunny bunny" (two beats) and pointing at a reciever.

If you're standing next to someone who recieves the energy, you say "ticky tocky" (two beats) while they point at themselves and recieve the energy, then say "ticky tocky" (two beats) while they send the energy at someone else.

Everyone else in the circle, chants "koom ba" (two beats) over and over while the energy is being sent and recieved. You're never silent in this game!

# Winners
If you make a mistake, you're out of the circle. Play until one person remains.
